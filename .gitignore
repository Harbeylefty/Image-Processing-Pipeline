# --- Python Packages Installed Locally for Lambda Zipping ---
# If you use "pip install -t ." to install packages directly into your Lambda source folders
# for zipping, you generally don't want to commit these library folders themselves.
# Add specific library folder names that appear after "pip install -t ."
# Example for Pillow:
PIL/
Pillow/
Pillow.libs/
# Add others if they appear, e.g., for other libraries if you don't use layers for them.
# The requirements.txt file *should* be committed.
